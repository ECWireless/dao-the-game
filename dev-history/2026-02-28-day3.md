# Day 3 - 2026-02-28 (UI Refinement Pass)

## Summary

- Shifted the app from “framed mockup” toward a more believable phone OS: mobile is full-bleed, desktop uses the hardware shell as a constraint.
- Kept the shell visually quiet and glass-forward so app interiors can carry the personality.
- Focused most work on making the first Messages-to-Mail flow feel like a real phone interaction instead of staged UI.

## Major Changes

- Removed noisy shell chrome (`RAID` / `CHAOS` stickers, extra helper text) and cleaned up top navigation.
- Rebuilt the dock as a persistent bottom tray with custom icons, app unlocks, and iPhone-style install progress.
- Refactored `GameScreen` and split the CSS into smaller modules so touched UI files stay under the 400-line rule.
- Moved app switching to icon-origin zoom motion and kept unlocked apps browseable while only the badged app can advance the story.
- Added a proper Messages contact header, a pinned mobile composer, typed canned replies, send animation, and stable per-beat chat animation timing.
- Condensed the opening chat into a tighter two-send exchange so the first incoming message animates on its own and the player is not dropped into a thread that already includes their earlier reply.
- Reworked the first beats into a two-send exchange with delayed follow-up timing so the opening chat feels paced instead of abrupt.
- Moved the Mail alert out of the chat footer into a shell-level top notification tray so it behaves like an iPhone banner.
- Cleaned up the phone-notification hook wiring in `GameScreen` so the shell-level alert timing stays lint-clean.

## Tradeoffs

- The shell and first-message flow are now much tighter, but app interiors beyond Messages/Mail are still comparatively simple.
- Timing is hand-tuned for feel; if the pacing changes later, the message animation delays will likely need another pass.

## Validation

- `pnpm typecheck` passed during the iteration cycle.
- `pnpm lint` passed during the iteration cycle.
- `pnpm test` passed during the iteration cycle.
- `pnpm build` passed repeatedly after the UI changes.

## Follow-Up

- Differentiate the remaining app interiors so each one feels as distinct as Messages and Mail.
- Keep tightening copy and timing in the first 3 beats before expanding further story content.
